              <ul className="ml-6 mt-2">
                <li>If the return is due to Vendor error (wrong item, defective, missing parts) or transit damage, the Vendor or LagBuy will cover reasonable return shipping costs.</li>
                <li>If the return is for any other reason (e.g., buyer simply changed their mind), the Buyer will be responsible for return shipping costs unless the Vendor offers free returns.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>5.5 <strong>Refund timing:</strong> Approved refunds will be issued as soon as practicable, typically within 7â€“14 business days after the return is accepted. The exact time for the refunded amount to reflect will depend on the payment provider or bank.</li>
